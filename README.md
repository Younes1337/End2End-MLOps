Introduction
Welcome to the MLOps project! This repository aims to showcase a comprehensive MLOps implementation, enabling smooth and efficient development, deployment, and maintenance of machine learning models. MLOps is the practice of integrating machine learning workflows with DevOps practices, ensuring reproducibility, scalability, and automation throughout the model's lifecycle.

Project Overview
The MLOps project provides a structured and organized pipeline for machine learning projects, covering the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model deployment. The primary goal is to streamline collaboration among data scientists, machine learning engineers, and operations teams, leading to a more efficient and reliable model deployment process.

🚀 Features
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Model training and evaluation
Model versioning and artifact management
Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
Automated model deployment to production environments
Monitoring and logging capabilities for deployed models
Scalable and adaptable architecture for various ML use cases
🔧 Tech Stack
The MLOps project utilizes the following main tools and libraries:

🧠 TensorFlow - an open-source machine learning library.
📚 Scikit-learn - a machine learning library for Python.
📦 MLflow - an open-source platform for the complete machine learning lifecycle.
🐋 Docker - containerization platform for packaging applications.
☸️ Kubernetes - container orchestration platform for deployment and scaling.
🛠️ Git - version control system for tracking changes in the codebase.
🏗️ Architecture
